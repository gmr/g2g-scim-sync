# g2g-scim-sync Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Implementation roadmap for the Google Workspace to GitHub Enterprise SCIM synchronization tool based on the PRD requirements.

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure, configuration, and CLI argument parsing complete
- ✅ All tests passing with 97% coverage
- ✅ BSD 3-Clause LICENSE file added
- ⏳ **Main sync logic needs implementation** (cli.py line 106)

## Core Implementation Tasks

### 1. Data Models & Structures
- [ ] Create Pydantic models for User data with SCIM attributes
- [ ] Create Pydantic models for Group/Team data structures
- [ ] Define Google Workspace user/group models
- [ ] Define GitHub SCIM user/team models
- [ ] Add validation and transformation logic

### 2. Google Workspace Integration
- [ ] Implement Google Admin SDK client class
- [ ] Add Google service account authentication
- [ ] Implement user fetching from Google Groups
- [ ] Add Google Group membership traversal
- [ ] Implement nested group flattening logic
- [ ] Handle API pagination and rate limits

### 3. GitHub SCIM Integration
- [ ] Implement GitHub SCIM API client class
- [ ] Add GitHub Enterprise authentication with SCIM token
- [ ] Implement SCIM user operations (create, update, suspend, delete)
- [ ] Add GitHub team creation and management
- [ ] Implement team membership synchronization
- [ ] Handle GitHub API rate limits and errors

### 4. Core Synchronization Engine
- [ ] Create main Synchronizer class to orchestrate sync process
- [ ] Implement user diff/comparison logic (Google vs GitHub state)
- [ ] Add team diff/comparison logic
- [ ] Implement sync planning (what changes to make)
- [ ] Add change execution logic with proper ordering
- [ ] Ensure idempotent operations

### 5. User Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Implement new user provisioning workflow
- [ ] Add user attribute update synchronization
- [ ] Implement user suspension/deactivation
- [ ] Add user deletion logic (with --delete-suspended flag)
- [ ] Handle edge cases and data validation

### 6. Team/Group Management
- [ ] Implement Google Group to GitHub Team mapping
- [ ] Add automatic GitHub team creation
- [ ] Implement team membership synchronization
- [ ] Handle nested group flattening (parent → multiple child teams)
- [ ] Add membership cascade logic for removals

### 7. Key Features
- [ ] Implement dry-run mode preview functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic for API failures
- [ ] Add rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- [ ] Ensure operations are idempotent and resumable

### 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Create unit tests for all core components
- [ ] Add integration tests with mocked Google Admin SDK
- [ ] Add integration tests with mocked GitHub SCIM API
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure 90%+ test coverage maintained
- [ ] Add performance tests for large user/group sets

### 9. Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Update README with detailed usage examples
- [ ] Create configuration guide with real-world examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guide for cron scheduling
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting recommendations
- [ ] Document security best practices

### 10. Final Polish
- [ ] Add comprehensive CLI help text and examples
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for long-running syncs
- [ ] Add configuration validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Final end-to-end testing

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Fetch**: Get users from specified Google Groups via Admin SDK
2. **Flatten**: Process nested group memberships into flat team list
3. **Compare**: Diff current GitHub users/teams via SCIM API
4. **Plan**: Determine what changes need to be made
5. **Execute**: Apply changes (users and teams) via SCIM API
6. **Log**: Record all operations for audit trail

### Key Dependencies
- `google-api-python-client` - Google Admin SDK integration
- `httpx` - HTTP client for GitHub SCIM API
- `pydantic` - Data validation and serialization
- `pytest` - Testing framework

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users in specified Google Groups appear in GitHub Enterprise
- [ ] Google Group hierarchy flattened to GitHub Teams correctly
- [ ] Suspended Google users become inactive in GitHub
- [ ] Tool runs reliably on cron schedule
- [ ] Comprehensive logging enables easy troubleshooting
- [ ] Dry-run mode provides accurate preview of changes
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage maintained throughout development
